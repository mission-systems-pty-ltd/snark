INSTALLATION

Currently only building from source using CMake is available. (After building
from source, you can generate deb package using CPack, though.)

Quickest way (works on Ubuntu 18.04 or higher with ansible playbook version 2.5 or higher)

> mkdir src
> cd src
> git clone <repo>
> ansible-playbook snark/system/ansible/install.yml --ask-become-pass

Manual way:

> mkdir -p src build/snark
> cd src
> git clone <repo>
> cd ../build/snark
> cmake ../../src/snark
> make
> sudo make install

Read install.yml, if interested in tweaking build configuration.

You could build a docker image (which will run ansible install.yml):

> docker build snark/system/docker -t snark.ubuntu-18.04.image

Not all snark components are turned on in install.yml, since you probably will
not need them all.

If you want to turn on/off various bits of snark, use snark/system/ansible/install.yml
and snark/system/docker/Dockerfile to create your own playbook and docker image.
